<body>
<p>This paragraph you are reading in this paragraph is no more afte running this document.</p>
<script> document.write(5+6)</script>
<p>Well the document.write() method didn't actually delete the element before it and this makes me to wonder. It is only to display the value of 5+6 and then delete the paragraph before it just as I read a while ago.</p>
