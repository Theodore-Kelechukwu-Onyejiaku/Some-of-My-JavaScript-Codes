		//JSON is a way of sending data and receiving data from a server in object form. This is done using JSON.stringify() - to pass to server and JSON.parse() - to convert string after receiving from server


		//FOR OBJECTS
		/*(1) Passing to server */
		let employee1 = {
			name : "Ukosa Grace",
			gender : "Female",
			dept : "IMT"
		}
		console.log(JSON.stringify(employee1)); //This would pass it to a server as : {"name":"Ukosa Grace","gender":"Female","dept":"IMT"}. With this method, we have turned this to JSON

		//FOR ARRAYS
		let employee2 = [
			{name : "Tewase Ann"},
			{gender : "Female"},
			{dept : "IMT"}
		]
		console.log(JSON.stringify(employee2)); //The JSON format would be: [{"name":"Tewase Ann"},{"gender":"Female"},{"dept":"IMT"}]



		/*(2) Collecting the data you have to convert it to the normal object format */
		let employee3 = `[
			{"age" : 23},
			{"tel" : 234},
			{"s_n" : 23 }
		]`;
		console.log(JSON.parse(employee3)); //The above array specifies how server returns the JSON. And to render it to our normal object form would be to use JSON.parse
		

//WOW the "backtick : `" is found under the Esc key
